# Master-thesis
Code for my master thesis concerning probabilistic matrix factorisation in collaborative filtering.

PMF1.py contains the probabilistic matrix factorisation implementation

BPMF.py contains the Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorisation implementation

BPMFURIC.py contains the Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorisation with user relations and item content implementation

Included are 3 jupyter files:
Data_procuement.ipynb - used for the initial preprocess of the dataset as well as the exploratory analysis
User_relations_item_content.ipynb - The process of creating C_j and F_i
Evaluation.ipynb - contains some of the code for making my graphs in the evaluation of the three algorithms

Note that this github, does not contain every code and file used in the process of creating my thesis. Furthermore, though I have added comments throughout my code, it is not nescessarily ready to be used by others. At some point I might beautyfi my code so other can use my implementation, but for now this is purely my documentation of implementation.
